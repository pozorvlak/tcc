There are millions of toy compilers in the world. This one is mine.

INSTRUCTIONS

To run some of the unit tests, you will need Nik Clayton's libtap library
installed. You can get it from http://github.com/pozorvlak/libtap.

If you have redo installed (http://github.com/apenwarr/redo) then you can build tcc and run the tests by typing

    redo

from the project root directory. If not, you can build tcc by typing

    ./do bin/tcc

but this does not support incremental builds. You may then run the tests by
typing

    prove -l
